## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for different screen sizes so it looks great on both desktop and mobile.  
- **Fixed Logo**: The logo stays in place while scrolling, providing a consistent visual anchor.  
- **Smooth Animations**: Transitions are used to animate the title, buttons on hover, and modal open/close smoothly.  
- **Interactive Elements**: Buttons trigger modal dialogs, and UI feedback is provided through hover states and transitions.  
- **Modular CSS**: Reusable classes make styling maintainable and extendable.  
- **Accessibility Considerations**: Features like `user-select: none` and intuitive controls for interactive components.
